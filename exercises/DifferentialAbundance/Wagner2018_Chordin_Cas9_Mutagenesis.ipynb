    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use MELD to characterize the effect of Cas9-mutagenesis in the zebrafish embryo. We will use a dataset generated by the Klein and Megason labs and published in [Wagner et al. (2018) (doi: 10.1126/science.aar4362)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29700229). Here, zebrafish embryos were injected with Cas9 + gRNAs at the one-cell stage targeting either chordin (*chd*) in the experimental condition or tyrosinase (*tyr*) in the control condition. Embryos were collected in a rough time course from 14-16 hours post fertilization for scRNA-seq and 27,000 cells were recovered.\n",
