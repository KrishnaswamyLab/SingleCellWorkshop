    "#### How does PCA work?\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA related eigendecomposition methods are some of the most fundamental dimensionality reduction tools in data science. Many methods, including tSNE and PHATE, first reduce the data using PCA before performing further operations on the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find many rigorous descriptions of the PCA algorithm online. Here, we will focus on the intutition. The goal of PCA is to identify a set of orthogonal dimensions (each of which is a linear combination of the input features) that explain the maximum variance in the data. These dimensions are called Principle Components. In the following figure, you can see data in two dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://krishnaswamylab.github.io/img/how_to_single_cell/PCA_original_data.png\" style=\"height: 25rem;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple dataset where the data exists in two dimensions. The axis of maximum variance in this data is going to be some line that goes up and to the right. If you were to identify the first two principle components in this data they would look like the dashed grey lines in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://krishnaswamylab.github.io/img/how_to_single_cell/PCA_PC1.png\" style=\"height: 35.35rem;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA then projects the points onto these new axes. Above, we see the projection onto PC1 (the longest dashed line) for a handful of cells denoted by the red arrows. Note that the arrows are orthogonal (perpendicular) to PC1. This is the definition of projection. Below, you can see what the projection of the data onto the first principle component would look like. Here we're doing the simplest dimensionality reduction. We've taken the data from two dimensions to 1 dimension. Notice how some information is lost here. Some points are very close on PC1 that are far in the original data space. Some information loss is unavoidable when reducing dimensions. Notice that if we considered a second PC, we would get that information back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization is a game of deciding what information you want to keep, and what you're comfortable throwing away. Here, we're looking at two dimensional data, but scRNA-seq usually has 20-30K data points. Some information will definitely be lost when considering only 1 or 2 principle components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** There exist as many PCs as there are original dimensions of the data, but we usually only consider the first 50-500 for single cell data. \n"
