    "## 2. t-SNE\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is tSNE?\n",
    "t-SNE is the most popular visualization method for single cell RNA-sequencing data. The method was first introduced by Laurens van der Maaten in 2008 in the aptly named article [\"Visualizing High-Dimensional Data Using t-SNE\"](http://jmlr.org/papers/v9/vandermaaten08a.html). The goal of t-SNE is to produce a two or three dimensional embedding of a dataset that exists in many dimensions such that the embedding can be used for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "By embedding, we're talking about projecting the data from high dimensions onto vectors in a smaller space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way t-SNE does this is by minimizing the difference between neighborhood distances (i.e. distances from a cell to a set of close cells) in the original high dimensional space and the lower dimensional embedding space. t-SNE is an optimization problem where the algorithm iteratively learns a series of transformations such that each successive transformation better minimizes this difference between the high and low dimensional neighborhood distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach preserves local structure in the data. Cells that are close in high dimensional space (i.e. have small Euclidean distances) will also be close in low dimensional space. However, it also means that global structure will not be preserved. This means that the distance between \"clusters\" in a t-SNE plot don't have any meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to use t-SNE effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike PCA, t-SNE has *hyperparameters* these are user-specified options that determine the output of t-SNE. Having hyperparameters isn't bad, but it is essential to understand what the hyperparameters are, what the effect of hyperpameter choices have on output, and how to select the best set of hyperparameters for a given research objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, a group from Google Brain published great essay in Distill about [\"How to Use t-SNE Effectively\"](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/). In the article, they provide an interactive tool to explore the effect of various hyperparameters of t-SNE on various datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main hyperparameters for t-SNE: **perplexity** and **learning rate** (sometimes called epsilon). Perplexity determines the \"neighborhood size\". Larger values of perplexity increase the number of points within the neighborhood. The reccomended range of t-SNE perplexity is roughly 5-50. Learning rate affects how quickly the algorithm \"stablilizes\". You probably don't need to change this, but should understand what it is."
