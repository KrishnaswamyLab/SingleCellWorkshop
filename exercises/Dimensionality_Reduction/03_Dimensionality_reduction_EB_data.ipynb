Larger values of perplexity increase the number of points within the neighborhood. The reccomended range of t-SNE perplexity is roughly 5-50. Learning rate affects how quickly the algorithm \"stablilizes\". You probably don't need to change this, but should understand what it is.\n",

    "PHATE is a dimensionaltiy reduction developed by the Krishnaswamy lab for visualizing high-dimensional data. We use PHATE for *every* dataset the comes through the lab: scRNA-seq, CyTOF, gut microbiome profiles, simulated data, etc. PHATE was designed to handle noisy, non-linear relationships between data points. PHATE produces a low-dimensional representation that preserves both local and global structure in a dataset so that you can make generate hypotheses from the plot about the relationships between cells present in a dataset. Although PHATE has utility for analysis of many data modalities, we will focus on the application of PHATE for scRNA-seq analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "PHATE is inspired by diffusion maps [(Coifman et al. 2008.)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acha.2006.04.006), but include several key innovations that make it possible to generate a two or three dimensional visualization that preserves continuous relationships between cells where they exist. For a full explanation of the PHATE algorithm, please consult [the PHATE manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/120378). **Note Dan/Scott Update the link to published paper**"

    "The API of PHATE models that of Scikit Learn. First, you instantiate a PHATE estimator object with the parameters for fitting the PHATE embedding to a given dataset. Next, you use the `fit` and `fit_transform` functions to generate an embedding. For more information, check out [**the PHATE readthedocs page**](http://phate.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like tSNE, PHATE has it's own set of hyperparameters. Changing the parameters will greatly change the output of the algorithm. We reccomend starting with the defaults, then change `knn` and `decay` according the reccomendations below. Generally, we won't select `t` ourselves, but if you're tuning hyperparameters, it's best to fix `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `knn` : Number of nearest neighbors (default: 5). Increase this (e.g. to 20) if your PHATE embedding appears very disconnected. You should also consider increasing `k` if your dataset is extremely large (e.g. >100k cells)\n",
    "* `decay` : Alpha decay (default: 15). Decreasing `a` increases connectivity on the graph, increasing `a` decreases connectivity. This rarely needs to be tuned. Set it to `None` for a k-nearest neighbors kernel.\n",
    "* `t` : Number of times to power the operator (default: 'auto'). This is equivalent to the amount of smoothing done to the data. It is chosen automatically by default, but you can increase it if your embedding lacks structure, or decrease it if the structure looks too compact.\n",
    "* `gamma` : Informational distance constant (default: 1). `gamma=1` gives the PHATE log potential, but other informational distances can be interesting. If most of the points seem concentrated in one section of the plot, you can try `gamma=0`.\n",
